Introduction
    React Shout Outs is a simple single-page application built with create-react-app that allows users to make announcements. Users can input a message, their name, and the date of the announcement, which will then be displayed at the top of the page as the latest announcement. This application serves as a coding assignment to understand basic React development and Git branching strategies.

Assignment Requirements

App Functionality
    The application must have an input form with three fields:
    A text box for the announcement message.
    A text box for the user's name.
    An input for the date, using a date picker component.
    The latest announcement should be displayed at the top of the page above the form.
    The page should update immediately when a new announcement is posted, displaying the most recent announcement prominently.

Branching and Styling
    The Git repository for this project should have at least two feature branches apart from the main branch.
    Feature Branch 1: This branch will contain a specific set of CSS styles that are different from the main and the second feature branch.
    Feature Branch 2: This branch will have a distinctly different set of CSS styles compared to the main and the first feature branch.
    Main Branch: This should have a combination of styles from both feature branches and should be considered the production branch.
    Each branch should significantly alter the appearance of the UI when checked out (git checkout [branch-name]).

Deliverables
    A working React application meeting the functionality requirements:
    A Git repository with at least three branches (main, feature branch 1, feature branch 2) with the appropriate styles implemented in each branch











# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
